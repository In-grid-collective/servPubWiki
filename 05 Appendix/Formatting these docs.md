Guidance for formatting for consistency:


### Things to decide:

1. How are including aside/notes? I've started using `Blocks`but does this look too much like code?
2. How should we refer to different machines i.e. laptop and pi, or personal machine/sysadmin machine and server, elsewhere we reference SBC
3. Do we want to have section subheadings i.e. [[01.3 SSH]]
4. We have lots of links out - some inline, some at the end with titles like Trouble shooting references: Do we want to standardise this at all?
