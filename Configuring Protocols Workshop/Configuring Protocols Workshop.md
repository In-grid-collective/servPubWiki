# (Con)figuring out Protocols Workshop

This was a workshop developed by In-grid to practice our own figuring out of technical infrastructure in action. This workshop was developed from the [Servpub](https://servpub.net/) docs which [In-grid](https://www.in-grid.io) developed from being in coalition with [SysterServer](https://systerserver.net/), [Creative Crowds](https://cc.vvvvvvaria.org/) and more[^1] during the setting up of the Servpub infrastructure. 

The 'Configuring Protocols' workshops aims to enable the process of retelling the stories and metaphors of technical network infrastructure as we make them. It is meant as a way to slow down, re-access and figure-out what we are actioning together. We approach this through building up technical docs through disobedient practices, oppositional reading, and troubling inquiries.

To do this we work collectively through a set of technical practices, this can be preformative and informative, or actioning real change. These can be setting up a new software or service, a social protocol or relational practice. We then analyse and open up together what figures and metaphors this practice is communicated and sustained through. In doing this, we can both question what are the politics and norms that this technology is sustained through, but also what in our context do we want to metaphor and maintain or infrastructure through. The metaphors, figures and narratives, as you will see in the examples bellow, can be held in names, operational metaphors and logos. It is up to you to find these frictions and see what rub up against your axis of norms and politics.

# Workshop

> re-orient to be about approaches to same material

There are two ways of doing this, either for performance (A), and to demonstrate in an accessible workshop how these practices are undertaken, or in the actioning of usable community  infrastructures (B). Both of these workshops can be accessed by taking part in the technical practice, or through being present and in conversation, to open up 

## Activating the Docs!

### Prep: Scoping A Technical Practice

1. Scope the participants abilities + time given to select an appropriate task from what is in your/the docs.
2. Edit up these steps from the docs, making sure to have a level that is accessible.
3. Reflect and inquire on which figures, metaphors, names, or logos to highlight. 
4. Write in these reflection points, but leave space for others to be found.
5. Make the steps accessible in both presentation slide and pad format, as well as wiki/git if you have access. At the minimum making sure their is an access copy.

### Workshop: (Con)figuring out Protocols

1. Make sure you are well prepared, and any technical setup has been tested before.
2. Welcome participants and gently help them get ready and setup for step 1.
3. Introduce them to the arc of the technical practice we are taking, and the mode of (con)figuring out as inquiry we are undertaking.
4. Take them through the steps of the docs, giving space for questions and (in)queeries. Encouraging and maintaining communal note taking, and going at the speed of that people need. 
5. Reflect as a group on the key points of figuring out. 
	1. What found friction and was a sticking point?
	2. What did we read it to mean?
	3. How did we re-imagine it?
6. Publish and make notes of inquiry accessible!

### Examples: 

#### Collective Infrastructures 4S/EASST

This workshop was run as part of the 4S/EASST combined panel called [Collective Infrastructures](https://nomadit.co.uk/conference/easst-4s2024/panel/14253) that In-grid members organised in 2024. The panel element of this brought together a number of communities to share their approaches and imaginaries to forming and caring for their own infrastructures. This workshop ran alongside this panel and meant to enable an accessible way to practice (con)figuring out infrastructures together. 

In this workshop together with participants we:
- SSH'd into the Servpub PI locally.
- Joined a collective TMUX session.
- ~~Edited a HTML file in Nano.~~ (didn't quite get there . . .)
- Exiting/maintaining collective space.

Along the way we questioned:
- Materiality of terminal
- Metaphors of SSH
- Intimacies of TMUX

- [On the collectively edited doc](https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html)
- [On the panel blog](https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures)

#### Serv(er)ing In-grid

This workshop was run in-ternaly for In-grid members by member George Simms. It focuses on using these workshop methods to setup and imagine In-grid's own network infrastructures. In this collectivley (con)figuring out how we want to approach and orient our new experimental VPS space with Servus.

In this workshop together with participants we:
- SSH'd into In-grid's remote VPS with Servus in Linz, Austria.
- Enter into Sudo.
- Create Users.
- Exchange SSH Keys with server.
- Join TMUX shared terminal.
- ~~Edited a HTML file in Nano.~~ (didn't quite get there . . .)
- ~~Exiting/maintaining collective space.~~ (didn't quite get there . . .)

Along the way we questioned:
- Maintaining histories of systems, even if bad.
- Taking care of sudo
- Many other metaphors of user/server
- Abundant imaginaries of safe spaces.

From this (Con)figuring out of in-frastructures we also formed our own manifesto, called the Femfester Manifesto. This was done by iterating our own version of the Feminist Server Manifesto and forming our own intentions for this space.
