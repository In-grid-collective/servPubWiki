# Configuring Protocols Workshop

This was a workshop developed by In-grid to practice our own figuring out of technical infrastructure in action. This workshop was developed from the [Servpub](https://servpub.net/) docs which [In-grid](https://www.in-grid.io) developed from being in collaboration with [SysterServer](https://systerserver.net/), [Creative Crowds](https://cc.vvvvvvaria.org/) and more[^1] during the setting up of the Servpub infrastructure. 

The 'Configuring Protocols' workshops aims to enable the process of retelling the stories and metaphors of technical network infrastructure as we make them. It is meant as a way to slow down, re-access and figure-out what we are actioning together. We approach this through building up technical docs through disobedient practices, oppositional reading, and troubling inquiries.

To do this we work collectively through a set of technical practices, this can be preformative and informative, or actioning real change. These can be setting up a new software or service, a social protocol or relational practice. We then analyse and open up together what figures and metaphors this practice is communicated and sustained through. In doing this, we can both question what are the politics and norms that this technology is sustained through, but also what in our context do we want to metaphor and maintain or infrastructure through. The metaphors, figures and narratives, as you will see in the examples bellow, can be held in names, operational metaphors and logos. It is up to you to find these frictions and see what rub up against your axis of norms and politics.

# Workshops

There are two ways of doing this, either for performance (A), and to demonstrate in an accessible workshop how these practices are undertaken, or in the actioning of usable community  infrastructures (B). Both of these workshops can be accessed by taking part in the technical practice, or through being present and in conversation, to open up 

## A: Demonstrative Workshop

### Prep: Scoping A Technical Practice

1. Scope the participants abilities + time given to select an appropriate task.
2. Write out the docs for these steps, making sure to have a level that is accessible.
3. Reflect and inquire on which figures, metaphors, names, or logos to highlight. 
4. Write in these reflection points, but leave space for others to be found.
5. Make the steps accessible in both presentation slide and pad format, as well as wiki/git if you have access. At the minimum making sure their is an access copy.

### Workshop: Practising Protocols

1. Make sure you are well prepared, and any technical setup has been tested before.
2. Welcome participants and gently help them get ready and setup for step 1.
3. Introduce them to the arc of the technical practice we are taking, and the mode of figuring out as inquiry we are undertaking.
4. Take them through the steps of the docs, giving space for questions and (in)queeries. Encouraging and maintaining communal note taking, and going at the speed of that people need. 
5. Reflect as a group on the key points of figuring out. 
	1. What found friction and was a sticking point?
	2. What did we read it to mean?
	3. How did we re-imagine it?
6. Publish and make notes of inquiry accessible!

## B: Actioning Community Infrastructure

### Prep: Feeling A Need/Desire

1. Over time feel our what a collective need is. You might be approaching this as you have a need in mind, or this might be a prompt to be present and start to inquire into what infra you might need that doesn't exist.
2. As a group start to discuss and form an idea from these feelings of what that infrastructure might be.
3. Try to name and focus in on what possible technologies exist to map to this desire.

### Action: Make The Infra
