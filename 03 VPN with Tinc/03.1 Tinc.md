### Install instructions for Linux:
The tinc install instructions in this guide zine work well. This is what we have used to install tinc on a pi. [https://psaroskalazines.gr/pdf/rosa_beta_25_jan_23.pdf](https://psaroskalazines.gr/pdf/rosa_beta_25_jan_23.pdf) 

We will be using apt to install development tools and dependencies before we download the source code of tinc. 

First we will download essential packages to  compile tinc as a sudo user.

```shell 
sudo apt install build-essential automake libssl-dev liblzo2-dev libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libreadline-dev 
```

Navigate into a tmp folder. - (Note: I was getting errors running the configure file in the tmp folder)

```shell
cd /tmp
```

Download tinc 1.1 with wget and uncompres the downloaded item to a folder with tar.

``` shell
wget https://www.tinc-vpn.org/packages/tinc-1.1pre17.tar.gz 
tar xvf tinc-1.1pre17.tar.gz
```

Navigate into the folder and run  the configure file to set tinc up.

``` shell
cd tinc-1.1pre17 
sh ./configure 
```

Install tinc!

```shell
make 
sudo make install
```

Once installed, create a configuration directory. All configurations of tinc will happen in this folder. Using tinc subcommands (like invite / join), result in changes to the files in this folder.

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/tinc/
```

The tinc executable is installed in 

`/usr/local/sbin/tinc `

This means that you can only run tinc as sudo, since sbin directory saves binary executables that can be ran only by sudo (s+bin)
