# Tinc: Joining a network

You should have the following to join a network:
- Tinc installed
- An invite link (e.g. `79.91.202.97/SVublahX7LapWXJdBzd03jNn48bxuN83jVE_23VnL`)
- A network name (e.g. `systerserver`)
- A VPN IP (e.g. `10.10.12.1`)

## Join VPN network

To  join the network use:

Syntax:
``` shell
sudo tinc -n <NETNAME> join <invite code>
```

so we did:
``` shell
sudo tinc -n systerserver join 79.91.202.97/SVublahX7LapWXJdBzd03jNn48bxuN83jVE_23VnL
```

## Add a subnet IP for you node

On the new node we will set the VPN ip address in the 10.10.12.x subnet, using the command below and the IP assigned to them.

Syntax:
```shell
sudo tinc -n <NETWORK NAME> add subnet <IP>
```

So we did:
```shell
sudo tinc -n systerserver add subnet 10.10.12.1
```

## Edit tinc-up:

This will setup you IP and visibility on the network.

Go to the configuration folder if you're not already there:
``` shell
cd /usr/local/etc/tinc/<NETNAME>
```

you can use `ls -a` to see all files in there, then edit the file called tinc-up. We are using nano to do our text editing.

via nano:
``` shell
sudo nano tinc-up
```

Once the file is open, edit it so it looks like this, filling in the correct details:

``` tinc-up
#!/bin/sh
#echo 'Unconfigured tinc-up script, please edit '$0'!'
#ifconfig $INTERFACE <your vpn IP address> netmask <netmask of whole VPN>
```

For servepub it would look like:
```
#!/bin/sh 
#echo 'Unconfigured tinc-up script, please edit '$0'!' 
ifconfig $INTERFACE 10.10.12.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

## Test

To test and run the service with debug:
``` shell
sudo tincd -n systerserver -D
```

## Ping node

Now we should be able to ping the other nodes ðŸ¤ž

``` sh
ping 10.12.12.0
```
