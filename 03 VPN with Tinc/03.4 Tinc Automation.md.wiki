= Start Tinc automatically =

We will now make the server and nodes (if you want them to) automatically setup and run the VPN. We are now going to get tinc to launch automatically with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd systemd]

== Create a systemd service file ==

Systemd is a way to manage (start/stop) services like VPNs etc. Tinc is such a service.

To do this you will create a new service file in the folder <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>

In this case we create a special kind of service file (that has an @ in the name) that allows it to work for multiple network names.

<source lang="shell">sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tinc@.service</source>
Inside that file, paste the following:

<pre class="service">[Unit] 
Description=Tinc (%i) 
After=network.target 

[Service] 
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/etc/tinc
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/tincd -D -n %i
ExecReload=/usr/local/sbin/tincd -D -n %i -kHUP 
TimeoutStopSec=5 
Restart=always 
RestartSec=60 

[Install] 
WantedBy=multi-user.target</pre>
== Starting Tinc service ==

Now we can start it with the command below:

Syntac:

<source lang="shell">sudo systemctl start tinc@<NETNAME></source>
so we did:

<source lang="shell">sudo systemctl start tinc@systerserver</source>
== Start service automatically ==

To make the VPN start automatically we enable it with:

Syntax:

<source lang="shell">sudo systemctl enable tinc@<NETNAME></source>
So we did:

<source lang="shell">sudo systemctl enable tinc@systerserver</source>
== Debug if any tinc servers are running ==

If you are having issues you can debug with:

<source lang="shell">systemctl --type=service | grep tinc</source>
