# Start Tinc automatically 

We will now make the server and nodes (if you want them to) automatically setup and run the VPN. We are now going to get tinc to launch automatically with [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) 

## Create a systemd service file

Systemd is a way to manage (start/stop) services like VPNs etc. Tinc is such a service. 

To do this you will create a new service file in the folder `/etc/systemd/system`

In this case we create a special kind of service file (that has an @ in the name) that allows it to work for multiple network names.

```shell 
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tinc@.service
```


Inside that file, paste the following:

``` service
[Unit] 
Description=Tinc (%i) 
After=network.target 

[Service] 
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/etc/tinc
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/tincd -D -n %i
ExecReload=/usr/local/sbin/tincd -D -n %i -kHUP 
TimeoutStopSec=5 
Restart=always 
RestartSec=60 

[Install] 
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Starting Tinc service

Now we can start it with the command below:

Syntac:
``` shell
sudo systemctl start tinc@<NETNAME>
```

so we did:
``` shell
sudo systemctl start tinc@systerserver
```

## Start service automatically

To make the VPN start automatically we enable it with:

Syntax:
```shell 
sudo systemctl enable tinc@<NETNAME>
```

So we did:
```shell 
sudo systemctl enable tinc@systerserver
```

## Debug if any tinc servers are running 

If you are having issues you can debug with:

``` shell
systemctl --type=service | grep tinc
```
