### Start tinc

After this, make sure that the server and the client are both running tinc. we are now going to get tinc to launch automatically with [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) 

#### Create a systemd service file

Systemd is a way to manage (start/stop) services like servers. Tinc is such a service. You can create new service files in the folder
`/etc/systemd/system`

In this case we create a special kind of service file (that has an @ in the name) that allows it to work for multiple network names.

```shell 
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tinc@.service
```


Inside that file, paste the following:

``` service
[Unit] 
Description=Tinc (%i) 
After=network.target 

[Service] 
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/etc/tinc
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/tincd -D -n %i
ExecReload=/usr/local/sbin/tincd -D -n %i -kHUP 
TimeoutStopSec=5 
Restart=always 
RestartSec=60 

[Install] 
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now we can start it with the command below:

``` shell
sudo systemctl start tinc@<NETNAME>
```

so for us it would be:

``` shell
sudo systemctl start tinc@systerserver
```

To make the VPN start automatically
```shell 
sudo systemctl enable tinc@<NETNAME>
```

e.g.:

```shell 
sudo systemctl enable tinc@systerserver
```



### Debug if any tinc servers are running 

``` shell
systemctl --type=service | grep tinc
```


# Todo

- systemctl

- [ ] read through and check.
