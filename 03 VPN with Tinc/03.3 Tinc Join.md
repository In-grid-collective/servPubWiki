 Example of given code: 
`79.91.202.97/SVublahX7LapWXJdBzd03jNn48bxuN83jVE_23VnL`

To  join the network use:

``` shell
sudo tinc -n <NETNAME> join <invite code>
```

so we did:

``` shell
sudo tinc -n systerserver join 79.91.202.97/SVublahX7LapWXJdBzd03jNn48bxuN83jVE_23VnL
```

servepub will then be asked to give their sudo password.

Then on servepub we will set the VPN ip address in the 10.10.12.x subnet, using the command below and the IP assigned to them e.g.

```shell
sudo tinc -n <NETWORK NAME> add subnet <IP>
```

For servepub it would look like:

```shell
sudo tinc -n systerserver add subnet 10.10.12.1
```

### Edit tinc-up:
On your machine, go to the configuration folder if you're not already there:
``` shell
cd /usr/local/etc/tinc/<NETNAME>
```

you can use `ls -a` to see all files in there, then edit the file called tinc-up. We are using nano to do our text editing.

via nano:
``` shell
sudo nano tinc-up
```

Once the file is open, edit it so it looks like this, filling in the correct details:

``` tinc-up
#!/bin/sh
#echo 'Unconfigured tinc-up script, please edit '$0'!'
#ifconfig $INTERFACE <your vpn IP address> netmask <netmask of whole VPN>
```

For servepub it would look like:
```
#!/bin/sh 
#echo 'Unconfigured tinc-up script, please edit '$0'!' 
ifconfig $INTERFACE 10.10.12.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
```


To test and run the service with debug:
``` shell
sudo tincd -n systerserver -D
```
