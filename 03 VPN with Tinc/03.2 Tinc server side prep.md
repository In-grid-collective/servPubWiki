### Use UFW to open up the necessary firewall

In this step, you will set up the default firewall ufw on all your server. You'll add OpenSSH service, add tinc VPN port, then start and enable ufw firewall.

First, add the OpenSSH service using the ufw command below. An output '**Rules updated**' confirms that the new rule was added to ufw.

``` shell
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
```

Add the port 655 that will be used by tinc VPN by entering the following command.

``` shell
sudo ufw allow 655
```

Now run the following ufw command to start and enable the ufw firewall. When prompted, input y to confirm and press ENTER to proceed.

``` shell
sudo ufw enable
```

Check its status with

``` shell
sudo ufw status
```

Tinc stores all configuration in `/usr/local/etc/tinc` Tinc allows multiple private networks to be defined, each is a folder with the name of the network, e.g. `/usr/local/etc/tinc/jean` (If you mess something up, you can restart by deleting the files that are there).
## Tinc: creating the initial network and inviting nodes


This step only has to happen once on the server hosting the vpn. In our case, it was performed on Jean. 

We created a virtual network named "constant" on the public node. Once this network is created, we use the public node to "invite" other nodes, for instance your laptop into this network. Invited nodes can then use tinc's *join* command to use the invite link. The generic form for initializing a new network named NETNAME is 

```shell
sudo tinc -n <NETNAME> init <NODENAME>
```

so we did 

``` shell
sudo tinc -n systerserver init servpub
```

To add a new client to the network you need to assign them a subnet of the VPN. For instance is the VPN IP is 10.10.12.x, we can give the new client a subnet IP i.e. 10.10.12.1.

Create a file to keep your list of private addresses. We use a file called `vpn-records` in `/usr/local/etc/tinc/`

Your file might look something like: 
10.10.12.1      servpub 
10.10.12.52    NewUser1 
10.10.12.53    NewUser2

run

``` shell
sudo tinc -n <NETNAME> invite <CLIENTNAME>
```

for instance, in our case if we want to invite a new client called 'servepub':

```shell 
sudo tinc -n systerserver invite servepub
```


the invite generated will be a long string of letters and numbers. It can then be passed over to servepub to run.
