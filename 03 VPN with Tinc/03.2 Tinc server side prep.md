### Use UFW to open up the necessary firewall

In this step, you will set up the default firewall ufw on all your server. You'll add OpenSSH service, add tinc VPN port, then start and enable ufw firewall.

First, add the OpenSSH service using the ufw command below. An output '**Rules updated**' confirms that the new rule was added to ufw.

``` shell
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
```

Add the port 655 that will be used by tinc VPN by entering the following command.

``` shell
sudo ufw allow 655
```

Now run the following ufw command to start and enable the ufw firewall. When prompted, input y to confirm and press ENTER to proceed.

``` shell
sudo ufw enable
```

Check its status with

``` shell
sudo ufw status
```

Tinc stores all configuration in `/usr/local/etc/tinc` Tinc allows multiple private networks to be defined, each is a folder with the name of the network, e.g. `/usr/local/etc/tinc/jean` (If you mess something up, you can restart by deleting the files that are there).
## Tinc: creating the initial network and inviting nodes

 
This step only has to happen once on the server hosting the vpn. In our case, it was performed on Jean. 

We created a virtual network named "constant" on the public node. Once this network is created, we use the public node to "invite" other nodes, for instance your laptop into this network. Invited nodes can then use tinc's *join* command to use the invite link. The generic form for initializing a new network named NETNAME is 

```shell
sudo tinc -n <NETNAME> init <NODENAME>
```

so we did 

``` shell
sudo tinc -n systerserver init servpub
```


### Add subnet ip

Then on the server we will set the VPN ip address in the 10.10.12.x subnet, using the command below and the IP assigned to them e.g.

```shell
sudo tinc -n <NETWORK NAME> add subnet <IP>
```

For servepub it would look like:

```shell
sudo tinc -n systerserver add subnet 10.10.12.0
```


### Edit tinc-up:
On your machine, go to the configuration folder if you're not already there:
``` shell
cd /usr/local/etc/tinc/<NETNAME>
```

you can use `ls -a` to see all files in there, then edit the file called tinc-up. We are using nano to do our text editing.

via nano:
``` shell
sudo nano tinc-up
```

Once the file is open, edit it so it looks like this, filling in the correct details:

``` tinc-up
#!/bin/sh
echo 'Unconfigured tinc-up script, please edit '$0'!'
#ifconfig $INTERFACE <your vpn IP address> netmask <netmask of whole VPN>
```

For servepub it would look like:
```
#!/bin/sh 
#echo 'Unconfigured tinc-up script, please edit '$0'!' 
ifconfig $INTERFACE 10.10.12.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

### Test 
To test and run the service with debug:
``` shell
sudo tincd -n systerserver -D
```


![[03.4 Tinc Start]]

### Invite nodes to network

10To add a new client to the network you need to assign them a subnet of the VPN. For instance is the VPN IP is 10.10.12.x, we can give the new client a subnet IP i.e. 10.10.12.1.

Create a file to keep your list of private addresses. We use a file called `vpn-records` in `/usr/local/etc/tinc/`

Your file might look something like: 


run

``` shell
sudo tinc -n <NETNAME> invite <CLIENTNAME>
```

for instance, in our case if we want to invite a new client called 'servepub':

```shell 
sudo tinc -n systerserver invite servepub
```

It will as for your host's external IP, press enter to use the default.

the invite generated will be a long string of letters and numbers. It can then be passed over to servepub to run.

Example of given code: 
`79.91.202.97/SVuslahX7LapWXJdBzd03jNn48bPuN83jVE_23VnL`


# ToDo

- UFW on server node only
- create invite

- [ ] needs clearing up as a bit confused with starting and joining a network.
- [ ] maybe can be more vis on what it shows.
