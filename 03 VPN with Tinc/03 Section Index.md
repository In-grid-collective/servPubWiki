# Tinc

tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses tunnelling and encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet. Find out [more](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/) 

You need to install tinc for all nodes, both server and client. 

If you would like to install on Mac, check out [[NA-Installing tinc on Mac.md.md|NA-Installing tinc on Mac]]. It's a little bit more complicated than Linux. If you want to install on Windows, it may be better to run tinc from a linux console [like this](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare)
