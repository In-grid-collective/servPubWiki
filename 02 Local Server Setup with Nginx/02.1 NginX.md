# NGINX

We will put nginx on our pi! To do this we will need to be working on our pi. To enter the pi we will use [[01-Set up Pi for local Network Access.md.md#Security via SSH Keys|SSH]].

Once in the pi, we will install the open source nginx from the command line using `apt`, there are [many other ways to install](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/). apt is a tool which allows you to download and install packages onto your device. 

In your terminal, run the command:
``` shell
apt install nginx
```

Note: packages are saved by default in your user's home directory. 
- [ ] clarify that this is where nginx is saved, not the location of the website files.

If you went to the IP address of your pi in web browser on a device that was on the same wifi network as the pi you would be able to see the default Nginx site already! Where is that coming from?

- [ ] reword this to clarify that a default webapge will be visible locally, both one your machine and from anohter machien that is connected to the same local network

Well, Nginx will create some default html files on installation. This is a very simple static website. To find that HTML index page in your file system on the pi, change directory to:

```shell
cd /var/www/html 
```

The default html document will be named `index.nginx-debian.html` which you can see if you run the `ls` command now. 

The default configuration file for this simple static site can be found here:

```shell
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ls
```

Here you will see that you have a configuration for the default server, you can open that up to look at it by running:

```
nano default
```

Here is a shortened version of what you should see with some added comments:

```nginx

server {
		# 80 the default port for listening for http traffic
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        # the root folder that your website will be served out of
        root /var/www/html;

		# Allowed file formats for the index / home page
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

		# The server name that you would set
        server_name _;

		# A location directive for any incoming URI requests
        location / {

                # First attempt to serve request as file, then as directory,
                # then fall back to displaying a 404 not found error
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
        
 }
```

This server block is where we define our server set up, this [nginx beginners guide does a good job of introducing the fundamentals](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html).

IMPORTANT: __DO NOT__ simply edit that default configuration file. Instead set up your own folder within `sites-enabled` to start serving your custom static site. This [Pitfalls and Common Mistakes guide](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/) should serve as a good resource to double check any changes you make. 

- [ ] should probably expand this with steps to creating the folder, rather than linking to the guide again.
### NginX debug
- [ ]  our problems, in-grid de-bug examples
### Proper sym link

``` bash
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/<conf-name>.conf ./sites-enabled/
```

## To Dos
- [ ] put in-line commands in single back-ticks
- [ ] link to/clarify what terminal is?
- [ ] Expand the NginX debug section with
- [ ] put symlinks in appropriate subsection
