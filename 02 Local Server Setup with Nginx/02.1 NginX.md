# NGINX

We will install nginx on our pi, this is the software that will make our pi into our *server*. To do this we need to be working on the pi, so we will use [[01-Set up Pi for local Network Access.md.md#Security via SSH Keys|SSH]] to access the pi from our personal machine.

- [ ] add here or in chapter, note on changing from pi to server 

> [!REMINDER] Reminder: Working on the pi
> Go to section [[01.3 SSH#Connecting from a client|01.3 SSH Connecting from a client]] to recap how to login to the server via SSH

Once you are logged in to your user on the pi, we will install nginx from the command line. We will use `apt` , which is a command-line utility that uses the Advanced Package Tool to download and install packages onto your device. 

In the terminal, run the command:
``` shell
apt install nginx
```

## File locations

Packages are saved by default in your user's home directory. The NginX software will also be saved inside the `etc` directory. We will work in here soon when we setup the config file of the server, for now just take note of where it is. The directory path is printed below:

```shell
cd /etc/nginx
```

Once NGINX is installed, it will create a few default HTML files that display a default webpage. This is a very simple static website. NGINX will save the website files in the `var` directory path below. We will work in here to edit our HTML index page.

```shell
cd /var/www/html 
```

Take a note of these two locations as we will be jumping between them in the coming steps.
## Configuring the html file

Inside the `/var/www/html` the default html document will be named `index.nginx-debian.html` which you can see if you run the `ls` command while in the directory.


The default configuration file for this simple static site can be found here:

```shell
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Here you will see that you have a configuration for the default server, you can open that up to look at it by running:

```
nano default
```

Here is a shortened version of what you should see with some added comments:

```nginx

server {
		# 80 the default port for listening for http traffic
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        # the root folder that your website will be served out of
        root /var/www/html;

		# Allowed file formats for the index / home page
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

		# The server name that you would set
        server_name _;

		# A location directive for any incoming URI requests
        location / {

                # First attempt to serve request as file, then as directory,
                # then fall back to displaying a 404 not found error
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
        
 }
```

This server block is where we define our server set up, this [nginx beginners guide does a good job of introducing the fundamentals](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html).

IMPORTANT: __DO NOT__ simply edit that default configuration file. Instead set up your own folder within `sites-enabled` to start serving your custom static site. 

This [Pitfalls and Common Mistakes guide](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/) should serve as a good resource to double check any changes you make. 

- [ ] should probably expand this with steps to creating the folder, rather than linking to the guide again.
### NginX debug
- [ ]  our problems, in-grid de-bug examples
### Proper sym link

``` bash
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/<conf-name>.conf ./sites-enabled/
```

## To Dos
- [ ] put in-line commands in single back-ticks
- [ ] Expand the NginX debug section with
- [ ] put symlinks in appropriate subsection
