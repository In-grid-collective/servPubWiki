The next step is to install and configure the software we need to make our pi into a server. We will be using [NginX](https://www.nginx.com/), an open source HTTP server software,  to create a simple static server. 

NginX also has other functions, and we will use it again in the [[04.1 NginX for Reverse Proxy|Reverse Proxy]] section of this guide. 

This section will take us through all steps needed to install, configure and implement some automated jobs in NginX.
