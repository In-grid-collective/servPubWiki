The next step is to install and configure the software we need to make our pi into a server. We will be using the open source [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/), an open source HTTP server software, to create a simple static server. 

There are  [many other ways to install NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/) and several other version of NGINX that can be used. This guide outlines the methods we used for ServPub using the open source version of NGINX.

This section will take us through all steps needed to install, configure and implement some automated jobs in NGINX that are needed to setup a server.  NGINX has many other uses, and in the [[04.1 NginX for Reverse Proxy|Reverse Proxy]] section of this guide, we will use it again to setup different parts of the network.
