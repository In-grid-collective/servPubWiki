The next step is to setup the software needed to make a set up a server on your pi. You can use a number of different tools and programming languages to create servers.

We will be using [NginX](https://www.nginx.com/)  which is a web serving software. You can use Nginx to create various types of servers. We will be creating a simple static server using Nginx on our Pi. We have also used Nginx for our reverse proxy server that redirects traffic coming in from the public internet, which will come to later here [[05-VPN and Reverse Proxy Server.md.md#NginX Reverse Proxy Server]]
