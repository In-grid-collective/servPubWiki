All the NGINX configuration we just setup should be saved and good to go. Next time we boot our server (if for any reason it shuts down) we want the server to be able to access and serve our website without manually starting NGINX.

Luckily NGINX does this by default, but here is how it works:

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell">systemctl enable nginx</syntaxhighlight>
To check if it is running:

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell">service nginx status</syntaxhighlight>
