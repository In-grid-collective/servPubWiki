## Testing out by hosting write freely

#### Install

I am testing writefreely on here as it is fairly easy to get started and is a markdown blog program (handy)

following tutorial [HERE](https://writefreely.org/start) but making sure to use ARM7 as this is what the pi runs on. 

for face less servers you can update the link bellow to download and unzip the file.

``` shell
wget -c https://github.com/writefreely/writefreely/releases/download/v0.14.0/writefreely_0.14.0_linux_arm7.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xz
```
