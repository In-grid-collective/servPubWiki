These docs describe the process of setting up the Servpub project infrastructure, which includes wiki4print, the server which hosts these docs. These docs act not only as a resource as to how to take up and hack these things yourself, but also to present alongside this the histories, networks and inspirations that have led us to this infrastructure's existence. 

### Access

We have tried to make these docs accessible and legible (as possible) to both technical and non-technical readings. If you want a light, but still deep exploration of the setup, check out the [Index of Pages](https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Docs:Contents#Index_of_Pages) listed below.

### Prerequisites

If you would like to follow along, the following are necessary:

- **Small board computer (SBC)
	- We used a raspberry pi, although You don't necessarily need to use a pi to create a collaborative environment, you could use another type of computer. To understand more about why we chose to use a pi, you can find our notes here`[Chapter 2a: Server Issues: Platform Infrastructure](https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Chapter_2a:_Server_Issues:_Platform_Infrastructure)`
* **Peripherals**
	* HDMI screen, keyboard, mouse etc. 
* **A laptop or other personal computer**
	* It would be good to have SSH installed on your laptop. Most OS have it by default now, if not then manually install following the steps under [[01.3 SSH]]
* **Knowledge of terminal/bash** 
	* For an intro to basic terminal/bash commands see [[05 Appendix/NA-Terminal Unix Commands Cheat Sheet|NA-Terminal Unix Commands Cheat Sheet]] 

### Note on terms

Throughout these docs we'll be referring to the server and the client. The client-server model in this context



- Server = Raspberry Pi/SBC (Single board computer)
- Client = your laptop


- Summary of the step for setting up tuxic.. Winnie
- Explain that there is a set of terms that are useful to understand - link to the static IP and Domain setup doc.
