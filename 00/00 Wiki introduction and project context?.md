_This guide is a work in progress compiled from research on setting up local servers, it will change to reflect the actual steps in-grid takes as we work on this project_

- [ ] Prerequisites of using terminal and command cheatsheet should go here? [[01 section index#Prerequisites]]


- [ ] Why we have put this here Winnie first step, can we include some writing that Winnie is doing about Tuxic for platform infrastructure? Radical reference? started drafting, see below
- [ ] Summary of the step for setting up tuxic.. Do we have any info about setting up the A record and pointing it to Jean's static IP. So maybe we just mention that we pointed the domain A record to the static IP. 
- [ ] Should we add the bit about client versus server terminology here? 
- [x] Explain that there is a set of terms that are useful to understand - link to the static IP and Domain setup doc. 

The first step that we took in this process was the purchase of the servpub.net domain name from [tuxic.nl](https://tuxic.nl/), we have therefore placed some introductory information about setting up domain names here.

- [[00.1 Network Terminology]] 
	- This section provides an overview of some of terms used in internet infrastructure.
