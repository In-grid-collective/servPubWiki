## Reverse Proxy Configuration


Add an nginx config file at ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/<SERVERNAME>.conf``

To do this use the command

```shell
cd /ect/nginx/
nano sites-available/<NETNAME>.conf
```

Ours looks like:

```shell
cd /ect/nginx/
nano sites-available/systerserver.conf
```

Choosing your NGINX reverse proxy setup is very much up to you but we will show to setups, a simple one with just http, and a more secure and standard one with https redirect and certificate. 

simple http conf:

``` nginx
server {
	# listen to http on port 80
	listen 80;
	listen [::]:80;
	# listen to url
	server_name servpub.net;

	# linking the client to the vpn subnet ip address of the pi
	location / {
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For
		$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

		# replace this with the user vpn subnet ip adress you set earlier 
		proxy_pass http://10.10.12.51;
		proxy_read_timeout 90;
	}
	
	location / {
		rewrite ^ https://$host$request_uri? permanent;
	}
}
```

More complex https, with http redirect, and certificate:

``` nginx

# A server to derirect http traffic to https
server {
		# listen on port 80 (http) of servpub.net
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        
        # listen to servpub, change to your url
        server_name servpub.net;

		# send trafic to https of the url
        return 301 https://servpub.net$request_uri;

}

server{
        # SSL configuration, listen to https of port 443
         listen 443 ssl;
         listen [::]:443 ssl;

		# link to ssl certificate on vpn server
         ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/servpub.net/fullchain.pem;
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/servpub.net/privkey.pem;

		# link to root folder
        root /var/www/html;

        # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

		# listen to servpub, change to your url. 
        server_name servpub.net;

		# linking the client to the vpn subnet ip address of the pi
        location / {
                proxy_set_header        Host $host;
                proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

				# replace this with the user vpn subnet ip adress you set earlier 
                proxy_pass              http://10.10.12.53; 
                
                proxy_read_timeout      90;

                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;


        }
        
}


```
