adduser Using [this guide](https://alexandria.anarchaserver.org/index.php/Access_server) from Systerserver, we can create users and give them different access levels. 
Before creating any new users, make sure you are at root level (or the root user) of the machine. To do that, do:
```shell
sudo su
```

To make a new user, use the command below. Note, that you will be prompted to input a password and it is always better to give different users passwords
```shell
adduser <nameofuser>
```

If you want to give this user sudo access, then they have to be added to the "sudo" group. You don't need to create this group, it exists by default and you can just add or remove users from it. The sudo group is stored in this directory: /etc/sudoers.d/
```bash
usermod -aG sudo <nameofuser>
```

You can check to see who is in the group sudo using this command:
```bash
 grep '^sudo:.*$' /etc/group
```

Now you can change into the new user (in other words, sign into their account):
```shell
su <nameofuser>
```
