## Armbian 

After flashing the Armbian disk image on the SD card, plug the Pi in and then just follow the prompts on screen.

If for any reason (like a power cut or accidental un-plugging) you have to enter the Armbian default username and password before you can boot the OS. It is usually:

- blank user name
- pw: 1234

(might need expanding on SD card flashing)

### Changing the host name
We can change the hostname from the default rpi4 to pubdoc (during workshop 26 June) by editing the files inside /etc/hostname 

with this command:

``` shell
hostnamectl hostname <newname>
```

we chose pubdoc, so:

``` shell
hostnamectl hostname pubdoc
```

then run this to show the status and confirm the the name of the hostname:

``` shell
hostnamectl status
```


Going forward, we will also have to name:

- The physical server machine, and its other future nodes
- one public user - collaboration
- one root user (if different)
- Separate user account (named after members)
- The domain (which will be publicly accessible)
