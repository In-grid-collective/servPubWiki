# Tmux installation

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, for collective editing in a terminal. Again, we are going to install this on the server (the pi). To use it you must be SSHed into the server as above  [[01-Set up Pi for local Network Access#Security via SSH Keys]].

So, assuming you are SSHed into your server, follow these steps.

To install:

``` shell
apt-get install tmux
```

To create a new tmux session sign into the user under which you would like the session to be registered (in our case sudo). We would do this by executing the command:

``` shell
sudo su
```

A tmux session is a shared terminal session where all those connected can input and execute commands synchronously. Below name your session, by replacing `[name]` with a name of your choice :

``` shell
tmux new -s [name]Â  
```

example:` tmux new -s mySession

To join the session when on a server use the following command replacing `[name]` with the name of the session:

``` shell
tmux a -t [name] 
```

example: `tmux a -t mySession`

Note: Everyone in a Tmux session is acting as the same user. However we can create split screens and multiple panes within Tmux so different people can work on different things.
