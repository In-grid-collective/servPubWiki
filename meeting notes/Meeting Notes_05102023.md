## Suggestions for "zine"
- Creating a "core" and "customisable" or "extended" version of setting up a server. Core would not include tinc for example
- Hosting an app on pubdoc now so we can give people something to go away with
- Creating annotated documentation that links out to different components within the text. 
	- Either through linked files like in Obsidian, 
	- or through pop-ups on another platform.
- Writefreely to make the documentation OR to host on pubdoc
